Note: this module uses the ASE package for modeling atomic systems. Due to the
 way that that the default ASE's LAMMPS calculator works that causes a loss in
 accuracy, some of the test cases (particularly in tests/TestMeam.py) will
 appear to fail. To solve this problem, copy src/misc/lammpsrun.py into your ASE
 /ase/calculators/ folder, overwriting the original lammpsrun.py (you may want
 to back this up, just to be safe).
